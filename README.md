# hugemouse
An unusably large mouse cursor

## Installation
Run `make` and you'll get a hugemouse binary

## Instructions
Run the `hugemouse` binary and the program will attempt to grow the mouse cursor as large as possible.

You may also specify a scaling factor:

  - `hugemouse 1` -- Return to normal mouse size
  - `hugemouse 4` -- The largest mouse size available in System Preferences
  - `hugemouse 16` -- Seems to be the largest size supported. Although no argument will attempt to scale up to 256

Fractional cursor sizes are not supported. This is "hugemouse", not "tinymouse".
